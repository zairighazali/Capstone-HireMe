export { default as FreelancerResults } from "./FreelancerResults";
export { default as FreelancerCard } from "./FreelancerCard";

// Note:
// this file acts as a barrel export for the Freelancers folder.
// it re-exports FreelancerResults and FreelancerCard
// so they can be imported from a single path elsewhere in the app.
// this helps keep imports cleaner and easier to manage.
